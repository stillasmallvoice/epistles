I used to call you "Heavenly Father."  
I could only address you in the most formal of language.  
It was hard to pray earnestly when the words weighed heavy on my tongue.  

But I think you still may have heard a few of them.  
(I have some feedback on the ones you must not have heard, but we'll get there.)  

I don't think you are a "Heavenly Father."  
I think its rather rude to insinuate that a being so powerful subscribes to **ANY** racial or gender identity,  
but I know **FOR SURE** there's no way you're a white man.  

I have no idea who you are,  
and to be honest,  
I don't really need to know.  

It's none of my business.  
I am merely dust moving through  
your cosmos.  

But I do believe it is valuable to commune with you.  
To connect myself to something larger than my narrow experience of this universe.  
To allow my heart the space to express its most pained desires.  

***Let us be free.***  
***Let us live as we wish to live.***  
***Let us love who we want to love.***  
***Let us travel and build community wherever we'd like.***  
***Let us move through the world as the most authentic, most compassionate versions of ourselves.***  
***Let us breathe.***  
***Let us rest.***  

Who / what / wherever you are -  
we need you now.  

amen
