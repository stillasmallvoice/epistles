# still a small voice

Our liberation will not come from on high.
<br>It will not come from a pedestal or a microphone.</br>

The true movement toward a more just and noble world will come in the fervent whispers among the proletariat.

In the still, small voices which have guided us out of the grasp of countless now fallen empires.

We bring their demise by eating away at the load-bearing lies they have fed to us.
<br>Termites infesting their sense of self.</br>

Keep gnawing.
<br>The collapse quickens.</br>
