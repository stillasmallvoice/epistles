Yesterday was a glorious, if private, celebration of one of the best days of the year.

There are very few people in my life that understand its significance or embrace its joy. Most don't even know its happening until I start talking about it. So, it always winds up feeling more like a private, religious celebration.

Which, honestly,
<br> **I'm okay with.** </br>

Most people I know here would likely not be able to hang at true Mardi Gras celebrations.  
These are not people who would do *The Wobble* multiple times alone in their apartments.

**But, I am.**

I understand the freedome that comes from giving into the music.  
In surrendering yourself to the party, and drinking in the joy and solidarity of a cultural moment of unabased reverie.

The history of Mardi Gras is as fraught as the history of the land on which it is held, but it was always in these celebrations where I witnessed a diverse community swaying to the same beat.
Standing shoulder-to-shoulder as the festivities roll down the road.

That's not to say all Mardi Gras celebrations are as inclusive as they should be,
but that every group within our community finds ways to mark the occassion and share joy among and without themselves.

So, I find myself doing that here.

Celebrating by myself as I bake King Cake and cornbread,  
my best pot of red beans **ever** simmering on the stove.

A little weed.  
Some Bailey's in the coffee.  
A steady stream of French 75's to keep the merriment going.

I made a playlist of parade classics and unique expressions of revelry.  
Only one person thought it slapped, but I listened to it all day, anyways.  
Dancing in my kitchen to a glorious flow of jazz, zydeco, and bounce -  
a delightful combo only found along my beloved Gulf Coast.

My life here is finally starting to come together - disparate pieces falling into place.  
I no longer fear I am still fighting to deserve to be here - that I must earn my place in such a large, important metro area.  
I know, now, that this is my home and the place where I've decided to build my life and my career,

**BUT**

There must always be space in my heart and my mind for my homeland.  
For the place that birthed me.  
For the community that did their best to bring me up well, even though they were operating (and had always been operating) under a state of delusion and misinformation.  
They did not know the things I now understand, but the propelled me forward anyways.  
The knew not to what I was being propelled, and many are adverse to where I've ended up and what I have decided to do, but I would not have gotten here without them regardless of what they think of me now.

Much of my work must now move, basically, underground.  
And that's how my Fat Tuesday felt:  
***a quiet expression of joy amidst overarching oppression and tyranny.***

We must not allow them to strip us of the beautiful pieces of our varied cultures which inspire joy, community, and the truest embrace of our shared humanity.

*We all want to eat.*  
*We all want our vices.*  
*We all want to dance.*  
*We all want to make love.*  
*We all want love,*
  *light,*
    *and peace*
      *in our lives*
        *and in our world.*

**Laissez les bon temps rouler.**  
***forevermore**
