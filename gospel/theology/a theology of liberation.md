Easter approaches,  
but today is Palm Sunday.  

Not often celebrated in my Southern mormon church,  
recognized, but not quite revered.  

We move into a Holy week.  
I never really knew that.  

I just looked forward to chocolate bunnies and deviled eggs.  
And I mourned the violence perpetuated by authority against another young soul begging for empathy and brotherly love.  
But we chose not to spent the week celebrating the work of blessing the meek and loving our neighbors.  
What a joyous, if somber, celebration of the message of  
*solidarity, hope, and collection liberation.*  
***Collective salvation.***  

I enter my Holy Week.  
I've come a long way from being *Woke Jesus* in a psych ward.  
I am healthy and grounded in reality.  
My body is recovering from the hell my brain inflicted upon it.  
The next, right steps forward are clear to me now,  
and the pieces are beginning to fall into place.  
I have focused my energy on understanding and healing myself.  
That full embrace of myself has drawn opportunities to me that I could have never imagined for myself.  

*I am well.*  
*I am sane.*  
*I am functional again,*  
***BUT** I am **NOT** the same.*  

I have been altered by the experiences I have had.  
*We have all been.*  
I have had many of those experiences with communities initially unfamiliar to me.  
I have witnessed the struggles to which my whiteness and generally relative financial stability had previously blinded me.  
I have been awakened to the pain of humanity.  

I am ***woke***.
He is Jesus.  
He is not my savior.  
*We must save ourselves.*  
He is my bright, north star.  
*We must follow his light even if that light oft shines on our own darkness.*  

We are not shown those horrors to condemn or guilt or shame.  
They are identified so we may clear them from the path.  
They are mere obstructions on our quest for  
**Heaven on Earth.**  

It is within sight,  
if we only open our eyes.
