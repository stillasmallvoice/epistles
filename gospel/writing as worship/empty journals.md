I could often be found in the staionery section of any store as a child.  
Ever fond of notebooks and pens, notecards and envelopes -  
I loved exploring what cute vessel could hold my next message.

I bought plenty of those journals.  
Always with the intention of beginning my documentation in earnest.

But if you snooped around my teenage bedroom, you would find no juicy diary filled with an adolescent's earliest encounters with humanity. And, no, you wouldn't even find the prayers of that devout mormon girl scribbled across those aesthetic pages.

Instead, you would find a stack of the nicest journals with most of the pages ripped out.

My commitment to what I was writing always faded quickly. I wish I could tell you I tore those pages out because I was afraid of the consequences I could face if anyone found them. And that may have been true sometimes. I'm positive those entries featured may boys I pined for at the time. But, honestly, I know I tore out those pages because I didn't believe the things I had written.

Not that I knew that then.  
I only remembered being embarrassed for some reason I didn't quite understand at the time.  
I know now that feeling was just ***CRINGE.***

I would reread my own words after writing them and have an immediate reaction of disgust.  
I thought I just hated my own writing.  
Which was true, I suppose,  
but now I know **WHY** I hated it.

***I was lying.***

Not consciously, of course.  
At that point in time, I fully believed all I had been taught and was 100% convinced I was moving along the right path and in the right direction.

**Deep down,**  
***I knew that wasn't true.***

It would be another decade before I came to that conclusion consciously.  
But, as a young writer, I instictively knew I was spewing bullshit.

It was not the content that made those pages cringe,  
***it was their inauthenticity.***

I was editing myself.  
Eliminating the delusion from my body of work.  
Keeping my most intimate of practices, my writing, pure -  
expelling the poison of the cult that encouraged me to write in the first place.

I often wish I could read some of those lost pages.  
See what I was thinking -  
with what I was wrestling.  
But I believe they are lost for a reason.

**They weren't my words.**  
**They were the words that were**  
***supposed to be mine.***

A life I was told to be leading, but that never felt right.

I am pleased that there are no lost pages anymore.

All of this is authentic.  
No more lying.

My writing is now:
* precise
* explicit
* intimate

And I hope it will be from now on.
