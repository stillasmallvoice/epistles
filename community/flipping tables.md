Today was the day.  
Today is the day.  
It has always been today.  

This is holy week.  

What we said we were doing  
*finally confronts*  
what we are actually doing,  
and what the fuck are we going to do about it.  

*It's now or never.*  

We either wash our hands of his blood  
or liberate him so that  
he may liberate us.  

**Kilmar Abrego Garcia**  
and every other neighbor stolen from us  
**MUST BE RETURNED.**  

They are children of our same god,  
and that god should surely abandon us  
as we have abandoned them.  

I didn't come this far  
to only go this far.  

My path becomes ever clearer.  
My job is to listen and report.  
Share with people the "good news"  
by recognizing how very bad this all is.
